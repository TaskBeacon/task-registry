## Overview

This repository serves two main purposes:

1. **Task Indexing and Documentation**: It provides a centralized index of all tasks hosted under the TaskBeacon platform, rendered using [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/) with the [Furo](https://pradyunsg.me/furo/) theme for clean, readable documentation.

2. **Community Task Proposals**: It acts as the entry point for researchers to propose new tasks via GitHub Issues, following a structured template and review process.
> **Note**: If your task is a variant of an existing task, please submit it as a new branch in the original repository instead of creating a new task proposal. Variants can be added as branches like  `variant/sst-audio`, etc.


### Step-by-Step: Submitting a New Task to TaskBeacon

#### 1. Make Sure Your Task Follows the TAPS Format

Ensure your local task folder includes the standard TAPS structure:

```arduino
your-task/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ assets/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ config/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.yaml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ run_trial.py
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.py         # optional
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ analysis.py      # optional
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/                # empty or example output
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md            # generated via task2doc or manually written
```

> Note: psyflow command line tool psyflow-init (or the taps() function) helps researchers quickly generate a project skeleton with these components pre-wired.

#### 2. Push to Your Own GitHub Repo (if not already)
Create a public repository under your GitHub account (e.g., `stroop`), then push your files:

```bash
git init
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourname/stroop.git
git add .
git commit -m "Initial version of emotional stroop task"
git push -u origin main
```

### 3. Go to the Task Submissions Repository

Visit:

```text

```

#### 4. Open a New Issue Using the Template

- Click ‚ÄúNew Issue‚Äù
- Select **New Task Proposal** (if configured)
- Fill in the form with:
  - Task name
  - Suggested repo name (e.g., `stroop`)
  - Short description of what the task measures
  - Link to your GitHub repo
  - Checkboxes for files included
  - Author and license info
  - Completion of the TAPS/psyflow checklist

#### 5. Wait for Admin Review

A TaskBeacon admin will:

- Review your task structure and documentation
- Leave comments or suggestions
- Approve and create a new official repository under the TaskBeacon organization
-**Add you (the original author) as a collaborator** to the new repository, so you can continue maintaining and improving it


Once live, your task becomes part of the open library. You can continue submitting:
- Bug fixes or updates via pull requests
- Variants as new branches (e.g., `variant/sst-audio`)
