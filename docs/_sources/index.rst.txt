Welcome to the TaskBeacon Task Registry!
=========================================

This site provides an organized index of available cognitive tasks.

Contributing to the Task Registry
---------------------------------

We welcome contributions to our task library! Here's a brief overview of how to get involved.

**Task Management:** Each task has its own repository, and different versions or "variants" are managed using Git branches. The `main` branch represents the primary, stable version of the task.

**Proposing Variants:** To propose a new variant for an existing task, please open a pull request against the corresponding task repository.

**Proposing New Tasks:** To propose a new task, please use the "New Task Proposal" issue template in our `.github` repository.

For more detailed information on versioning, variants, and our contribution process, please see our full documentation:

`TaskBeacon Versioning Guide <https://taskbeacon.github.io/versioning.html>`_
