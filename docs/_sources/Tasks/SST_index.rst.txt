Stop-Signal Task
================

The **Stop-Signal Task (SST)** is a widely used experimental paradigm in cognitive neuroscience and psychology to study **response inhibition**—the ability to suppress prepotent or ongoing actions. First formalized by Logan and Cowan in the 1980s, the SST builds on the **horse-race model**, which conceptualizes response execution and inhibition as two independent processes competing in time.

In a typical SST, participants respond to go stimuli (e.g., left/right arrows), but must withhold their response when a stop signal (usually a tone or visual cue) appears shortly afterward. The delay between the go and stop signal—called the **stop-signal delay (SSD)**—is dynamically adjusted to estimate the **stop-signal reaction time (SSRT)**, a key measure of inhibitory control.

Over time, numerous **variants** of the SST have been developed, including versions with emotional or motivational cues, modified timing strategies, and neurophysiological adaptations using EEG or fMRI. The SST remains a gold standard for probing executive control across both healthy and clinical populations.
