## 1. Task Overview
This task is a classic N-Back cognitive test. Participants are shown a sequence of digits and must determine if the current digit matches the one presented 'N' trials ago. The task includes two blocks: a 1-Back block and a 2-Back block.

## 2. Task Flow
### Block-Level Flow
| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| 1. Instruction | For each block (1-Back then 2-Back), instructions are displayed. The first half of the blocks are 1-Back, the second half are 2-Back. |
| 2. Trial Execution | The block runs for a set number of trials, as defined in `config.yaml`. |
| 3. Block Break | After each block, a break screen is shown with the accuracy for the 'match' trials in that block. |
| 4. Goodbye | After all blocks are complete, a "goodbye" message is displayed. |

### Trial-Level Flow
| Step | Description |
|---|---|
| 1. Digit Presentation | A digit is presented on the screen for the duration specified by `cue_duration`. The participant can respond during this time. |
| 2. Inter-Trial Interval (ITI) | A blank screen is shown for the duration specified by `iti_duration`. |

### Other Logic
| Function | Description |
|---|---|
| `generate_nback_conditions` | This function generates the sequence of trials for each block. It ensures a specific ratio of 'match' to 'non-match' trials, and controls for the number of consecutive 'match' trials. |

## 4. Methods
Participants perform an N-Back task, a continuous performance paradigm used to measure working memory. The experiment is divided into two blocks: a 1-Back and a 2-Back condition. In each trial, a digit (1-9) is presented on the screen. Participants are instructed to press the spacebar if the current digit is identical to the digit presented N trials previously (a "match").

The task begins with a 1-Back block, followed by a 2-Back block. Each block consists of 20 trials. The sequence of stimuli is pseudo-randomly generated to contain approximately 30% match trials. A digit is displayed for 800ms, during which a response can be made. This is followed by a 1200ms inter-trial interval. Feedback on accuracy for match trials is provided at the end of each block.
